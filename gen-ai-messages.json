I think the ability for a high IQ entity to think a lot on multiple ideas repeatedly and then follow a chain of deep research on each of them would eventually lead to discoveries. This has never been possible before. I can't be confident that this would be available on tap using LLM architecture, but seems like we could at least get there by brute force\n\n\n\nHere's an example exploration just to illustrate my point: https://chatgpt.com/share/67c9fd75-80c4-8003-a5f1-898a54724c16\n\n\n\nNow scale this up to 1000 ideas instead of 5.

I think the ability for a high IQ entity to think a lot on multiple ideas repeatedly and then follow a chain of deep research on each of them would eventually lead to discoveries. This has never been possible before. I can't be confident that this would be available on tap using LLM architecture, but seems like we could at least get there by brute force\n\nHere's an example exploration just to illustrate my point: https://chatgpt.com/share/67c9fd75-80c4-8003-a5f1-898a54724c16\n\nNow scale this up to 1000 ideas instead of 5.

For example, in table 1 where they train the model for 150b tokens, the model is retrained on mathpile ~16 times whereas only ~3 times on proofpile 2. Am I interpreting this correctly? If yes how does this affect the results, is it a confounding factor where retraining multiple times rither makes the model overfit on that data or actually learn intricate things about math and for a fair comparison each model must be retrained a similar number of times?",

That's handleable\n\"insights\" questions: where alerts needs to be thrown when there's an anomaly; also forecast based on past, and draw other strategic insights\n\nWhat're the best ways to deal with second part.

They have a verifier (whose true performance is unknown) and a set of rewards (+1 for correct answer, +x for following answer format, +x for coherence, length etc.) Now two things can happen in reward hacking here, 1. the model sees that the verifier can be tricked to give a positive reward by using certain tokens in the answer (is very easy to check, for example take a question whose answer (big word problem) would come out to be a+b-c, sample it ~300 times, you will see cases where it thought things like a + b - kc were right where k is a constant, this happens as the verifier thought ‚Äòa‚Äô, ‚Äò+‚Äô , ‚Äòb‚Äô, ‚Äò-‚Äò and ‚Äòc‚Äô are tokens required for right answer in that ‚Ä¶",

I‚Äôve asked the latest reasoning models simple logic puzzles or riddles with a detail (could be irrelevant or critical, but straightforward to a human) tweaked, and all of them get it wrong. LLMs are still extremely fragile and unpredictable ‚Äúreasonsers‚Äù, and until models demonstrate robustness on even simple out-of-distribution reasoning tasks, I think any AGI or even fully autonomous usage talk is a pipe dream.",

    "text": "I‚Äôm also experimenting with this. Metabase allows exporting and importing dashboards as yaml (but only in the paid version), so you could get an LLM to generate the yaml directly (only issue is that the documentation is not that great on that front). \n\n\n\nLightdash is leaning into this use case a bit more directly but this is also really new for them: https://docs.lightdash.com/references/dashboards-as-code\n\n\n\nOther tools like Superset also have json/rest APIs to create dashboards. \n\n\n\nFor me the ideal solution would be one where the GUI is still the one provided by an existing BI tool so the AI generated dashboards can be easily tweaked/edited/extended/copied through that GUI by anyone in the team (as opposed to only through code/AI generation). \n\n\n\nNot sure if you have the same use case in mind but if you do I‚Äôd happy to share notes.",

My observation from pov of overall product development is devs and designers in existing roles will not start using Cursor or Figma AI plugins well enough till the time its the only way they can get their work done. My PMs also hardly used Enterprise ChatGPT till I asked if they have had the doc or analysis vetted by AI.\nMost big US companies ( including the one I worked at ) have little work compared to a startup. In current setup even if cursor worked well for them it would only help get work done faster, but they won't pickup more work. It's only when the backfills don't happen and team size reduces will people try to get better at using the AI tools they have and apply the right pressure on these tool makers t",

Such agents will be able to actively explore the world, adapt to changing environments, and discover strategies that might never occur to a human.",

These changes herald a transition from exclusively human-privileged communication, to much more autonomous interactions where the agent is able to act independently in the world. Such agents will be able to actively explore the world, adapt to changing environments, and discover strategies that might never occur to a human.",

The efficiency gain is down to how quickly the developer can identify the problem areas - that are are going to be performance or security issues and will become a drag.\n\n\n\nA junior developer will quite often not see those issues because they won't have that experience. It won't be until it gets compiled, it gets merged into the main product pipeline and deployed and then tested that those issues will become apparent. By that time, it's a lot slower to fix because the release is delayed, it's sent back to another developer or to a different team with a whole series of issues attached to it that need to be resolved\n\n\n\nsome estimated ballpark numbers that were presented to be",

We have used Victoria DB as our time series. Another important aspect is the node exporters but that again depends on your infrastructure. Buying Observability stack is expensive for instance New relic or datadog, but again it depends on read write transactions, if you have the money then go ahead and buy it but your data is going to them",
